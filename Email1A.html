  Would you be open to an on-site evaluation of one of our video borescope units?&nbsp; I don’t need to be there, we can just ship you the unit (at our expense, of course) and you can use it for a week or two to see how it performs.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it meets your expectations, we can move toward a purchase, if not, I’ll send you a shipping label to get the scope back to us.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you haven’t used a state-of-the-art video borescope recently, you really do owe it to yourself to take this test drive.  Our scope saves time and money, and improves quality, for hundreds of companies like yours.

  Please let me know when it would be convenient to have a quick call to set up your demo.&nbsp; You can reply to this email or call me at my office or on my mobile.
